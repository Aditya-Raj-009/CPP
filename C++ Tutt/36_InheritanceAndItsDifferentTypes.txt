/**
 * Four form of Inheritance in C++:
 * Single Inheritance: A->B (A: base class and B: Derive class.)
 * Multiple Inheritance : A,B -> C (C can inherit both A and B).
 * Hierarchical Inheritance: A and B both inherit C.
 * Multilevel Inheritance. A inherit B , B inherit C and so on.
 * Hybrid Inheritance: (Multiple + Multilevel Inheritance).
